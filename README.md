##Homework - Week 14: Node Express Handlebars

This is a  restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars.
Follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a *`Devour it!`* button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
